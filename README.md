# Project RedPoint

RedPoint is an open source cell-based multi-language web-application notebook for taking and sharing programming notes. Current support for renderable Markdown as well as executeable Javascript, Ruby and Python cells.

## Use Case: Note-Taking, Code Presentation and Code Sharing

Focused on users who are learning a new programming language, code cells can be executed which will display the output, return value and any errors associated with executing the cell. All cells of the same language are connected in state, allowing for illustrative and formatted markdown cells (which support images) to be interleaved with demonstrative code cells.

Multiple langauges are executable within the same notebook, to allow the illustration of language differences.
